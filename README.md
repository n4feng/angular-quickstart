# angular-quickstart
The test application made for technical interview

To test the program you should open the server by "node server.js" command in terminal, than check it in http://localhost:8080/

Right now I could only save the canvas in json in the folder called "save", but I can't re-read it base on the user front end request

The main files I am working on are: server.js, public--(index.html, styles.css, controller.js), and public--deadcode.js is where I put unused code.

Here are the resources I have checked while making this application:
